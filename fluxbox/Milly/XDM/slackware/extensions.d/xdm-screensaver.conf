#
# Configuration file for the extension xdm-screensaver
#
# On system with multiple X servers, there might be a configuration 
# file per X server.
#
# The xdm-screensaver configuration file dedicated to an X server must 
# be named xdm-screensaver.<XDISP>.conf and stored in same directory as 
# script xdm-screensaver.
#
# <XDISP> is the X server display name, without field 'screennumber',
# and to XDM resource name format, that is, with underscores in place
# of dots and colons. For instance, the value of XDISP for the X server
# display name :0 is _0. It is _1 in case of X server display name :1,
# and so on.
#
# When there is no configuration file dedicated to a given X server, 
# xdm-screensaver loads the default configuration file xdm-screensaver.conf.
#
# The default configuration file xdm-screensaver.conf can be used as a 
# base configuration inside the configuration file dedicated to a given
# X server, like in example below : 
#
#  8<--- xdm-screensaver._1.conf ---------------------------------------
#    # Loads defaults
#    #
#    source ${EXTDIR}/xdm-screensaver.conf
#
#    # Change screensaver used on Xserver :1
#    #
#    SCREENSAVER=glmatrix
#
#    # Sets extra-arguments for glmatrix screensaver on Xserver :1
#    #
#    SCREENSAVER_EXTRA_ARGS=( -dna -clock )
#  8<-------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Here are the list of variables defined by Xsetup that can be 
# useful in this configuration file :
#
#  XDISP     : the X server display name to XDM resource name format.
#  SCRIPTDIR : Absolute path to Xsetup's directory.
#  EXTDIR    : Absolute path to Xsetup extensions directory.
