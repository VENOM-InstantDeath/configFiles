#
# Configuration file for Xsession
#
# On system with multiple X servers, there might be a configuration 
# file per X server.
#
# The Xsession configuration file dedicated to an X server must be named 
# Xsession.<XDISP>.conf and stored in same directory as script Xsession.
#
# <XDISP> is the X server display name, without field 'screennumber',
# and to XDM resource name format, that is, with underscores in place
# of dots and colons. For instance, the value of XDISP for the X server
# display name :0 is _0. It is _1 in case of X server display name :1,
# and so on.
#
# When there is no configuration file dedicated to a given X server, 
# Xsession loads the default configuration file Xsession.conf.
#
# The default configuration file Xsession.conf can be used as a 
# base configuration inside the configuration file dedicated to a 
# given X server, like in example below : 
#
#  8<--- Xsession._0.conf ----------------------------------------------
#    # Loads defaults
#    #
#    source ${SCRIPTDIR}/Xsession.conf
#
#    # Disable sourcing of all profile scripts.
#    #
#    SOURCE_SYS_PROFILE=off
#    SOURCE_USR_PROFILE=off
#    SOURCE_SYS_XPROFILE=off
#    SOURCE_USR_XPROFILE=off
#
#  8<-------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Here are the list of variables defined by Xsession that can be 
# useful in this configuration file :
#
#  XDISP     : the X server display name to XDM resource name format.
#  SCRIPTDIR : Absolute path to Xsession's directory.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# TWO STATES VARIABLES:

# Full path to the user's X session.
#
USR_XSESSION=${HOME}/.xsession

# Full path to the system's X session.
#

# The location of xinitrc.* session files.
#
XINITRC_FILES_DIR=/etc/X11/xinit

#
SYS_XMODMAP=/etc/X11/xinit/.Xmodmap

# Full path to the user's X modmap.
#
USR_XMODMAP=${HOME}/.Xmodmap

# The name of the sessions for which Xsession must load the
# X resources (specified by SYS_XRESOURCES and USR_XRESOURCES)
# when available.
#
# Most of the xinitrc scripts usually load the X resources 
# automatically. Thus, this variable should only be used for 
# those who don't.
#
# failsafe is a pseudo-session for which there is no xinitrc
# script.
#
LOAD_XRESOURCES_ON=( "failsafe" )

# The name of the sessions for which Xsession must load the
# X modmap (specified by SYS_XMODMAP and USR_XMODMAP) when 
# available.
#
# Most of the xinitrc scripts usually load the X modmap 
# automatically. Thus, this variable should only be used 
# for those who don't.
#
# failsafe is a pseudo-session for which there is no xinitrc
# script.
#
LOAD_XMODMAP_ON=( "failsafe" )

# Defines the files in which (session) errors can be redirected.
#
# Errors are only redirected to one of the specified files, the 
# 1st that met the following condition :
#
#   umask 077 && cp /dev/null XSESSION_ERRFILE[i] 2>/dev/null
#
# Errors are not redirected when this variable is not set, nor
# when the condition above is not met by any of the specified 
# files. 
#

# Defines whether or not the system profile script /etc/profile
# must be "sourced" by Xsession, when present. Default to on.
#

# must be "sourced" by Xsession, when present. Default to on.
#
SOURCE_SYS_XPROFILE=on

# Defines whether or not the user x-profile script ~/.xprofile
# must be "sourced" by Xsession, when present. Default to on.
#
SOURCE_USR_XPROFILE=on

# Defines the terminal emulator to execute when running failsafe
# mode.
#
# The failsafe mode is ran when all possible sessions (ie. session 
# passed in argument (if any), ,session selected from the buttons-bar 
# sessions menu (if any), user's session, system's default session) 
# failed to start.
#
FAILSAFE_TERM=/usr/bin/uxterm

# Defines the geometry of the terminal emulator specified by
# variable FAILSAFE_TERM.
#
# When this variable is not set, no geometry is passed to the 
# terminal emulator.
#
