#
# Configuration file for Xsetup
#
# On system with multiple X servers, there might be a configuration 
# file per X server.
#
# The Xsetup configuration file dedicated to an X server must be named 
# Xsetup.<XDISP>.conf and stored in same directory as script Xsetup.
#
# <XDISP> is the X server display name, without field 'screennumber',
# and to XDM resource name format, that is, with underscores in place
# of dots and colons. For instance, the value of XDISP for the X server
# display name :0 is _0. It is _1 in case of X server display name :1,
# and so on.
#
# When there is no configuration file dedicated to a given X server, 
# Xsetup loads the default configuration file Xsetup.conf.
#
# The default configuration file Xsetup.conf can be used as a 
# base configuration inside the configuration file dedicated to a 
# given X server, like in example below : 
#
#  8<--- Xsetup._1.conf ------------------------------------------------
#    # Loads defaults
#    #
#    source ${SCRIPTDIR}/Xsetup.conf
#
#    # Redefine the wallpaper for X server :1
#    #
#    XDMBGIMG=/usr/share/wallpapers/Autumn/contents/images/1920x1080.jpg
#  8<-------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Here are the list of variables defined by Xsetup that can be 
# useful in this configuration file :
#
#  XDISP     : the X server display name to XDM resource name format.
#  SCRIPTDIR : Absolute path to Xsetup's directory.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# TWO STATES VARIABLES:
# ====================
# The possible values of two-states variables below are 1,on,yes,true,0,
# off,no,false :
#
#     DISABLE_LOG                  WITH_COMPTON
#     WITH_BUTTONS_BAR             WITH_XCLOCK
#     WITH_NUMLOCK_ON              PRIMARY_ONLY

          ###
          #    Variables    #
                          ###

# Defines whether or not logging of Xsetup activity must be 
# disabled. Default to off.
#
# Activity is logged in /var/log/xdm-xsetup.${XDISP}.log
# 
DISABLE_LOG=off

# Defines the locale used while running XDM.
#
XDM_LOCALE=en_US.UTF-8

# Defines whether or not Xsetup must start the compositor 
# compton if installed. Default to on.
#
# Attention, WITH_COMPTON is automatically disabled when the 
# image viewer "feh" (1) is not installed. This is required 
# because when "feh" is not available, setxdmbg uses "display"
# which is incompatible with compton: the background is greyed
# and compton emis bunch of messages like as below :
#
#   [5.43] error 141 BadPicture request 138 minor ....
#
# (1) available at slackbuilds.org. 
#
WITH_COMPTON=on

# The compton arguments.

# Defines if Xsetup must start the buttons-bar (ie. Xbuttons_bar). Default 
# to on.
#
WITH_BUTTONS_BAR=on

# Defines the position of the buttons-bar. Can be set to one
# of the following : 
#
#   TOP_LEFT (default)
#   TOP_RIGHT
#   BOTTOM_LEFT
#   BOTTOM_RIGHT
#
BUTTONS_BAR_POSITION=TOP_LEFT

# Defines if Xsetup must start xclock if installed. Default to on.
#
WITH_XCLOCK=off

# Defines the position of xclock. Can be set to one of 
# the following:
#
#   TOP_LEFT
#   TOP_RIGHT (default)
#   BOTTOM_LEFT
#   BOTTOM_RIGHT
#
XCLOCK_POSITION=TOP_RIGHT

# Defines the font of the xclock widget.
#
# Below some (good) alternatives to the default :
#
#      -adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--17-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
#    -adobe-helvetica-medium-r-normal--17-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
#        -adobe-times-medium-r-normal--17-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
#  -urw-nimbus mono l-medium-r-normal--17-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
#        -ibm-courier-medium-r-normal--17-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
#
XCLOCK_FONT="-misc-dejavu sans light-extralight-r-normal--17-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

# Defines the foreground color of the xclock widget.
#
XCLOCK_FG_COLOR=#717171

# Defines the strftime format of the date/time displayed by
# the xclock widget.
#
XCLOCK_STRFTIME="%T"

# Defines if the num lock must be activated (*) when starting
# xdm. Default to on.
#    
# (*) using numlockx (available at slackbuilds.org). 
#
WITH_NUMLOCK_ON=on

# Defines whether or not the XDM background and widgets (xclock,
# buttons-bar, ...) must be displayed on the primary screen only
# when XDM is running on a multi-screen configuration. Default to
# on.
#
# Note that Xsetup has no control over the display on which the XDM
# greeting and login prompt are displayed.
#
PRIMARY_ONLY=on

# Defines the identifier of primary display. 
#
# Can be any existing output supported by xrandr (ex. VGA-1, HDMI-0, 
# DVI-D-0,...), or the keyword "auto", to auto-detect the primary 
# display. Default to "auto".
#
# This property is ignored when PRIMARY_ONLY is set to off.
#
# PRIMARY_ONLY is turned off when the given identifier is invalid, or 
# when this property is set to "auto" and none of the displays listed 
# by xrandr is defined as primary.
#
PRIMARY_ID="auto"

# Full path to the image that Xsetup must pass to setxdmbg to generate
# the XDM background image.
#
# When this property is not set, XDM background is black, unless if compton
# is enabled, in which case the background is greyed. To prevent this, 
# WITH_COMPTON must be turned off.
#
# By default, this variable points the symlink 'default-wallpaper.pixmap'
# in directory ${SCRIPTDIR}/pixmaps, so that, user can change the XDM 
# background image source without to have to edit this configuration file.
#
XDMBGIMG=${SCRIPTDIR}/pixmaps/default-wallpaper.pixmap

# The height and color of the border at top of the XDM background
# image when the buttons-bar and/or xclock widget is/are enabled 
# and placed on top.
#
# The value of this property must be to the format: <height>:<color>
#
# <color> can be an X11 color name or an hex triplet to the format
# #rrggbb.
#
# Important:
#   The border is drawn with imagemagick which does not use the 
#   same color names as xclock/xmessage
#
#   For instance, imagemagick associates the color c(0,80,0) to
#   the name "green", while X11 associates this name to the color
#   C(0,255,0).
#
BORDER_TOP=30:#0f1013

# The height and color of the border at bottom of the XDM background
# image when the buttons bar and/or xclock widget is/are enabled and
# placed on bottom.
#
# The same format and informations as for BORDER_TOP apply to this
# property.
#
BORDER_BTM=30:#0f1013

# The imagemagick extra image operators that Xsetup must pass
# to setxdmbg to generate the XDM background image.
#
# Attention, extra image operators can be time consuming the 
# first time the XDM background image is generated.
#
# setxdmbg (only) supports the imagemagick image operators
# below :
#
#   -adaptive-blur <radius[xSigma]>  -adaptive-sharpen <radius[xSigma]>
#   -auto-gamma                      -black-threshold <value[%]>
#   -blue-shift <factor>             -blur <radius[xSigma]>
#   -brightness-contrast <B[xC][%]>  -charcoal <factor>
#   -colorize <percent>              -fill <color>
#   -contrast                        -contrast-stretch <BP[xWP][%]>
#   -emboss <radius>                 -enhance
#   -fft                             -flip
#   -flop                            -gaussian-blur <radius[xSigma]>
#   -grayscale <method>              -monochrome
#   -negate                          +noise <type>
#   -ordered-dither <map[,lvl...]>   -paint <radius>
#   -posterize <levels>              -radial-blur <angle>
#   -raise <thickness>               +raise <thickness>
#   -sharpen <radius[xSigma]>        -sketch <radius[xSigma[+angle]]>
#   -solarize <percent-threshold>    -tint <value>
#
# For instance, to use the image operators '-blur 3' and 
# '-paint 4' to generate the XDM background image from the
# image pointed by 'XDMBGIMG', 'EXTRAIMGOPS' must be set to :
#
#   EXTRAIMGOPS=( "-blur 3" "-paint 4" )
#
# Note that '-fill', which is not an operator, is required 
# by operators '-colorize' and '-tint'. Therefore, to use
# any of these operators, '-fill' will have to be specified
# too, like in example below :
#
# EXTRAIMGOPS=( "-fill blue" "-colorize 4" )
#
# For more about image operators supported by setxdmbg, view this
# page: https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php
#
EXTRAIMGOPS=()

# Defines the Xsetup extension(s).
#
# An extension is a shell script which adds new feature(s) to
# Xsetup.
#
# The extensions must be in the folder "extensions.d" of Xsetup's 
# directory. They are loaded/executed at the end of Xsetup according 
# to the order in which they are declared.

EXTENSIONS=("sysmon-conky")
