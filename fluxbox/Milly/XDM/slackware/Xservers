# Xservers for xdm-slackware-theme

# This file should contain an entry to start the server on the
# local display; if you have more than one display (not screen),
# you can add entries to the list (one per line).  If you also
# have some X terminals connected which do not support XDMCP,
# you can add them here as well.  Each X terminal line should
# look like:
#	XTerminalName:0 foreign

# Starts the (default) X server on the local display :0 paired
# to vt7
#

# display :1 paired to vt8
#

# If you need a 3rd X servers, uncomment the line below to start
# it on the local display :2 paired with vt9
